# Superpowers Requesting Code Review For SPARK-workflow

Review before calling the work done.

## Inputs

- what changed
- what it was supposed to do
- which tasks or milestone were completed
- the relevant diff or file set

## Review Setup

1. Summarize the implemented scope and the artifact references.
2. Provide the reviewer with the minimal code and requirement context they need.
3. Ask for findings against correctness, regressions, missing cases, and maintainability.
4. Route the feedback through [../superpowers-receiving-code-review/SKILL.md](../superpowers-receiving-code-review/SKILL.md) before acting on it.

## Guardrails

- review after meaningful milestones, not only at the very end
- do not ask for a vague “looks good?” review with no requirements context
